<!-- Your plan for the Guess Genius game sounds great! Here's a breakdown of how the logic could flow:  

### Game Flow:
1. **Start Screen:**
   - Includes a "Start Game" button.
   - Instructions or a brief overview of the game.

2. **Game Screen:**
   - Displays the current round number (e.g., "Round 1/20").
   - Timer countdown (10 seconds per round).
   - Hint section at the bottom to guide the player.
   - Text input for the player to enter their guess.
   - "Guess" button to submit the answer.

3. **Logic for Each Round:**
   - Start the timer when the round begins.
   - Display the hint for the current round.
   - Check the user's guess:
     - If correct: Display success feedback and move to the next round.
     - If incorrect or time runs out: Display failure feedback and move to the next round.
   - Keep track of the user's score (e.g., correct guesses).

4. **Results Screen:**
   - Shows the total score and detailed performance:
     - Number of correct guesses.
     - Time taken for each round.
   - A button to restart the game.

5. **High Score Screen:**
   - Displays the highest score achieved by the user.
   - Option to return to the start screen or play again.

### Key Features:
- **Hints:** Provide subtle clues to guide the player. For example, if the number is between 1 and 100, a hint might be "Greater than 50" or "Even number."
- **Timer:** Countdown displayed prominently, with a sound effect or visual indicator for the last few seconds.
- **Feedback:** Immediate feedback after each guess (e.g., "Correct!" or "Try Again!").
- **Scoring:** Track correct guesses and provide a score summary at the end.

### Extras for Engagement:
- Reward animations for correct answers.
- Dynamic difficulty, where hints get less specific as the game progresses.
- A streak bonus for consecutive correct guesses.
